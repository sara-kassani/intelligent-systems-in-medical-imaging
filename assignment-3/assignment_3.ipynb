    "In this assignment, we are going to develop a system for automatic segmentation of airways in chest CT scans. The input data is a 3D volume of the human thorax. An example of *coronal* slice of this 3D volume is shown in Figure 1a. The output of this assignment is also a 3D volume containing binary values for each voxel, indicating whether it belongs to an airway or not. The output airway segmentation should be a single **connected component**. An example of this output is shown as a coronal 2D overlay in Figure 1b and as a 3D volume in Figure 1c.\n",

For the larger airways, the thick airway walls provide a clear separation between the airway lumen and the surrounding lung parenchyma. However, this separation becomes less pronounced for smaller airways because of limitations in resolution and partial volume effects, which often results in a segmentation that leaks into the lung parenchyma as is shown in Figure 2b and 2c. \n",

A robust method to automatically segment an airway tree in CT is especially relevant for quantifying airway changes such as thickening of the airway wall and changes in lumen diameter. Quantifying these airway changes may be key for improving the diagnosis and treatment planning for pulmonary diseases involving airway pathology such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis. In addition, segmented airways can aid in segmenting other pulmonary structures such as lobes, segments, and pulmonary arteries and veins."
